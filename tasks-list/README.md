# 📝 TasksList

Welcome to the **TasksList** mini project! This project is a simple yet effective task management app where you can create tasks, track their progress, and update their status. It was designed to help me practice key Angular concepts, such as **services** and **dependency injection**, which are essential to developing scalable applications.
