# üìö The Complete Guide to Angular - Course Projects

This repository contains the projects developed during the Udemy course, [**The Complete Guide to Angular**](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-guide-to-angular-2). The projects reflect the key concepts and skills acquired throughout the course, which covers **Angular** up to version 18.

## üöÄ Overview

The course covers essential Angular concepts and the latest features in **Angular 18**. This repository showcases these concepts through practical projects and exercises, emphasizing real-world applications such as component architecture, routing, state management, form handling, and interaction with REST APIs.

## üõ†Ô∏è Core Concepts Covered

### 1. **Components & Databinding**
   - Understanding **components** as the core building blocks of Angular applications.
   - Implementing **property binding**, **event binding**, and **two-way binding** to create dynamic UIs.
   - Utilizing **EventEmitters** and **custom events** to facilitate communication between parent and child components.
   - Implementing **content projection** to create flexible and reusable components.

### 2. **Directives**
   - Working with **built-in directives** like `ngFor` and `ngIf` to control rendering and behavior of the DOM.
   - Creating **custom directives** to extend the capabilities of HTML elements.

### 3. **Services & Dependency Injection**
   - Building and utilizing **services** to share functionality across multiple components.
   - Managing dependencies using Angular‚Äôs **dependency injection** system.
   - Leveraging Angular's **signals** for state and event management.

### 4. **Routing & Navigation**
   - Setting up **routing** to navigate between different views in an application.
   - Working with **route parameters** and protecting routes using **route guards**.
   - Implementing **lazy loading** to optimize the performance of larger applications by loading modules only when required.

### 5. **Forms & Validation**
   - Building forms using **FormsModule** for template-driven forms and **ReactiveFormsModule** for reactive forms.
   - Implementing real-time **form validation** using both synchronous and asynchronous validators.
   - Managing complex form structures and dynamic form controls for better user input handling.

### 6. **HTTP Requests & REST APIs**
   - Sending **HTTP requests** (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) using Angular's `HttpClient` to interact with **REST APIs**.
   - Handling **error responses**, managing data streams, and using interceptors to modify HTTP requests globally.

### 7. **Authentication**
   - Managing **token-based authentication** to secure different parts of the application.
   - Protecting routes and managing sessions with **Auth guards** and tokens for access control.

### 8. **State Management with NgRx**
   - Implementing state management using **NgRx** for managing state changes across the application.
   - Handling **complex state management** efficiently across different components to maintain a consistent UI.
   - Using **selectors** and **reducers** to manage and retrieve specific parts of the application‚Äôs state efficiently.
